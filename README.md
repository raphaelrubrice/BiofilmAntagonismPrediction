### **ðŸ“Œ Abstract**
Biofilms are structured microbial communities that promote cell interactionsthrough close spatial organization, leading to cooperative or competitive behaviors. Predicting microbial interactions in biofilms could aid in developing innovative strategies to control undesirable bacteria. Here, we present amachine learning approach to predict the antagonistic effects of beneficial bacterial candidates *Bacillus* and *Paenibacillus* species against undesirable bacteria (*Staphylococcus aureus*, *Enterococcus cecorum*, *Escherichia coli* and *Salmonella enterica*), based on the morphological descriptors of single-species biofilms. We trained the models using quantitative features (e.g. biofilmvolume, thickness, roughness or substratum coverage). As a proxy for antagonism, an exclusion score was used as the supervised training target. The latter was calculated based on the ratio of biofilm volume between the undesirable bacteria growing and the beneficial strain. We then used diverse explainability  methods to analyze the resulting model and found insights highlighting the importance of biofilm formation context when predicting antagonism. Our results demonstrate that machine learning can provide an efficient, data-driven tool to predict microbial interactions within biofilms and support the selection of beneficial strains for biofilm control. This approach enables scalable screening of microbial interactions, applicable in agriculture, healthcare, and industrial microbiology.

## **âš¡ Installation**

### **ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites**
- **GPU Access:** Required for optimal performance
- **CUDA-Compatible GPU:** Needed for accelerated training and preprocessing.

### **ðŸ”§ Setting Up the Environment**

Using **conda**:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate BAP
```

Using **pip** and virtual environments:
```sh
python -m venv BAP_env
source BAP_env/bin/activate  # Windows: BAP_env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸ”§ **Installing LightGBM (CUDA) & cuML**

Run the following script before using the repository to ensure LightGBM and cuML are properly set up:

```bash
bash install_script.sh <path_to_clone_LightGBM>
```

Replace `<path_to_clone_LightGBM>` with the desired location where LightGBM should be cloned and built.

To verify GPU support:
```python
import lightgbm as lgb
print(lgb.__version__)
print(lgb.__file__)
```
Ensure the output points to a CUDA-enabled LightGBM installation.
